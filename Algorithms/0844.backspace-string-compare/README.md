# [844. Backspace String Compare](https://leetcode.com/problems/backspace-string-compare/)

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` _if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors_. `'#'` means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "ac".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "a#c", t = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: s becomes "c" while t becomes "b".
```
