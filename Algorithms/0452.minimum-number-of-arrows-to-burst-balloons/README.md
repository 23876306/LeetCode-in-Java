# [452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/)

There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array `points` where `points[i] = [x<sub>start</sub>, x<sub>end</sub>]` denotes a balloon whose **horizontal diameter** stretches between `x<sub>start</sub>` and `x<sub>end</sub>`. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up **directly vertically** (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with `x<sub>start</sub>` and `x<sub>end</sub>` is **burst** by an arrow shot at `x` if `x<sub>start</sub> <= x <= x<sub>end</sub>`. There is **no limit** to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array `points`, return _the **minimum** number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].
```

## Solutions
### [Sorting + Greedy](MinimumNumberOfArrowsToBurstBalloons.java)

Idea: We can sort balloons based on the end position. When we shot an arrow from the end position, the next intervals donâ€™t contain this position will be counted as another shot. (Greedy).

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMinArrowShots(int[][] points) {
        if (points.length == 0)
            return 0;
        Arrays.sort(points, Comparator.comparingInt(p -> p[1]));
        int ans = 1, end = points[0][1];
        for (int i = 1; i < points.length; i++) {
            if (points[i][0] > end) {
                ans++;
                end = points[i][1];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: $O(n\log n)$. The time complexity of sorting is $O(n\log n)$ and the iteration is $O(n)$. The total time complexity is $O(n\log n)$.
- Space Complexity: $O(\log n)$. The space of sort stack is $O(\log n)$.
