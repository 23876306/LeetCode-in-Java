# [869. Reordered Power of 2](https://leetcode.com/problems/reordered-power-of-2/)

You are given an integer `n`. We reorder the digits in any order (including the original order) such that the leading digit is not zero.

Return `true` _if and only if we can do this so that the resulting number is a power of two_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 10
Output: false
```
