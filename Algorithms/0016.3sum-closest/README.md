# [16. 3Sum Closest](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/)

Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`.

Return _the sum of the three integers_.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
Output: 0
```
