# [392. Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` _if_ `s` _is a **subsequence** of_ `t` _, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"<u>a</u>b<u>c</u>d<u>e</u>"` while `"aec"` is not).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```
