# [126. Word Ladder II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder-ii/)

A **transformation sequence** from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s<sub>1</sub> -> s<sub>2</sub> -> ... -> s<sub>k</sub>` such that:

- Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
- Every `s<sub>i</sub>` for `1 <= i <= k` is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.
- `s<sub>k</sub> == endWord`

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return _all the **shortest transformation sequences** from_ `beginWord` _to_ `endWord` _, or an empty list if no such sequence exists. Each sequence should be returned as a list of the words_ `[beginWord, s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>, ..., s<sub>k</sub>]`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: [["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]]
Explanation: There are 2 shortest transformation sequences:
"hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog"
"hit" -> "hot" -> "lot" -> "log" -> "cog"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: []
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
```
