# [160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/)

Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return _the node at which the two lists intersect_. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

**Custom Judge:**

The inputs to the **judge** are given as follows (your program is **not** given these inputs):

- `intersectVal` \- The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is `0` if there is no intersected node.
- `listA` \- The first linked list.
- `listB` \- The second linked list.
- `skipA` \- The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listA` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
- `skipB` \- The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Intersected at '8'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Intersected at '2'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_3.png)

```
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: No intersection
Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
```

## Solutions
1. [Traverse all list](./IntersectionOfTwoLinkedLists.java)
    - Time Complexity is O(N) and space complexity is O(1).
    - Logic: When we access to the listA's tail, set the next node to the first node of the ListB. Similarly, when we access to the ListB's tail, set the next node to the first node of the ListA. Suppose the length of listA is a and the length of listB is b. a + b = b + a. If there is no intersection, l1 and l2 would be null simultaneously.
    - Runtime: faster than 98.97%.
    - Memory usage: less than 89.04%.
