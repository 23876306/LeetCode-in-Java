# [409. Longest Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome/)

Given a string `s` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return _the length of the **longest palindrome**_ that can be built with those letters.

Letters are **case sensitive**, for example, `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abccccdd"
Output: 7
Explanation:
One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "bb"
Output: 2
```
