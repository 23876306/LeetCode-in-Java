# [227. Basic Calculator II](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator-ii/)

Given a string `s` which represents an expression, _evaluate this expression and return its value_.

The integer division should truncate toward zero.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of `[-2<sup>31</sup>, 2<sup>31</sup> - 1]`.

**Note:** You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "3+2*2"
Output: 7
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = " 3/2 "
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = " 3+5 / 2 "
Output: 5
```
