# [1235. Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-profit-in-job-scheduling/)

We have `n` jobs, where every job is scheduled to be done from `startTime[i]` to `endTime[i]`, obtaining a profit of `profit[i]`.

You're given the `startTime`, `endTime` and `profit` arrays, return the maximum profit you can take such that there are no two jobs in the subset with overlapping time range.

If you choose a job that ends at time `X` you will be able to start another job that starts at time `X`.

**Example 1:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/10/10/sample1_1584.png)**

```
Input: startTime = [1,2,3,3], endTime = [3,4,5,6], profit = [50,10,40,70]
Output: 120
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first and fourth job.
Time range [1-3]+[3-6] , we get profit of 120 = 50 + 70.
```

**Example 2:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/10/10/sample22_1584.png)**

```
Input: startTime = [1,2,3,4,6], endTime = [3,5,10,6,9], profit = [20,20,100,70,60]
Output: 150
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first, fourth and fifth job.
Profit obtained 150 = 20 + 70 + 60.
```

**Example 3:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/10/10/sample3_1584.png)**

```
Input: startTime = [1,1,1], endTime = [2,3,4], profit = [5,6,4]
Output: 6
```

## Solutions
### [Dynamic Programming + Binary Search](./MaximumProfitInJobScheduling.java)

Idea: We first sort `endTime` from small to large. We use `dp[i]` to represent maximum profit of the first $i$ part time job, which is the maximum profit of $[0,i-1]$. `dp[0]` means donâ€™t have any part time job which equals to 0. For $i \gt0$, depending on whether the $i-1$ part time job is selected we can conclude the following equations:

$$
dp[i]=max(dp[i-1],dp[k]+profit[i-1])
$$

$k$ is the number of part time jobs which its end time are less than or equal to the start time of the $i-1$ job.

```java
class Solution {
    private int binarySearch(int[][] jobs, int right, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (jobs[mid][1] > target) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
    
    public int jobScheduling(int[] startTime, int[] endTime, int[] profit) {
        int n = startTime.length;
        int[][] jobs = new int[n][];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            jobs[i] = new int[]{startTime[i], endTime[i], profit[i]};
        Arrays.sort(jobs, (a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]);
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int k = binarySearch(jobs, i - 1, jobs[i - 1][0]);
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], dp[k] + profit[i - 1]);
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: $O(n\log^n)$. Sort is $O(n\log^n)$ and iteration + binary search is also $O(n\log^n)$. Thus, the total time complexity is $O(n\log^n)$.
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$. We use $O(n)$ space to save dp.
